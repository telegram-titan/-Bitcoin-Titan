## Token Distribution

The distribution of **Bitcoin Titan (BTC)** tokens follows a halving model, inspired by the original Bitcoin distribution:

- **Manual Distribution (Current Phase)**: Each distribution is manually done with **50 BTC tokens** per transaction.
- **First Halving**: Once the community reaches **10,000 members**, the distribution amount will be halved to **25 BTC per transaction**.
- **Second Halving**: After **20,000 members**, the distribution will reduce to **12.5 BTC** per transaction.
- **Third Halving**: At **30,000 members**, the amount will again be halved to **6.25 BTC** per transaction.

The halving process helps ensure a controlled, gradual release of tokens and rewards early adopters.
