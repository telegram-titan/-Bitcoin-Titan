# Bitcoin Titan Token Distribution

The distribution of **Bitcoin Titan (BTC)** tokens follows a phased approach inspired by the original Bitcoin halving model, ensuring a balanced and controlled release of tokens over time. 

## Manual Distribution Phase (Initial Phase)
At the start of the **Bitcoin Titan** project, the distribution of tokens will be done manually to early community members and participants. 

- **Initial Distribution Amount**: Each transfer will consist of **50 BTC tokens**. This amount symbolizes the early Bitcoin rewards that were given to miners when Bitcoin was first launched.
- **Why 50 Tokens?**: The decision to distribute 50 tokens per transfer is in honor of Bitcoin's early distribution method, which rewarded miners with 50 BTC per block during its initial stages.

## Halving Model

In line with Bitcoin’s philosophy, **Bitcoin Titan** implements a halving model to reduce the token distribution over time as the community grows. Here’s how the halving works:

1. **After 10,000 Community Members**:  
   Once the **Bitcoin Titan Community (BTC)** reaches **10,000 members**, the amount of BTC distributed per transaction will be reduced by half, from **50 BTC to 25 BTC**.
   
2. **After 20,000 Community Members**:  
   When the community grows to **20,000 members**, another halving will take place, reducing the token distribution to **12.5 BTC** per transaction.

3. **After 30,000 Community Members**:  
   At the **30,000 member** milestone, the distribution will again be halved, reducing it to **6.25 BTC** per transaction.

## Why Halving?
The halving model is implemented to:
- Control the supply and ensure that the tokens are distributed in a way that preserves their value.
- Reward early adopters with a higher distribution rate.
- Maintain a long-term, sustainable distribution model for the community.

The halving will continue as the community expands, reflecting the decentralized and community-driven nature of the **Bitcoin Titan** project.

## Current Distribution Stage
We are currently in the **Manual Distribution Phase**, with **50 BTC** being distributed per transaction. Join the community and participate in the early distribution before the first halving occurs at 10,000 members!
